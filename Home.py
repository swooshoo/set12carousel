I noticed with their recent success with their Netflix Series "Arcane" that many new players are speculating to join Riot Games' Teamfight Tactics, an auto-chess style game with a relatively tall knowledge curve. 
While there are various sites that provide various statistics and dashboards for experienced players, very little provide basic, UI/UX friendly knowledge that even I myself as an experienced player find hard to use.

Hopefullly this site helps ease new players into trying the game before throwing them into the overwhelming data many sites throw at a user.
